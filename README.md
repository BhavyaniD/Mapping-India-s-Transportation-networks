# 🇮🇳 Mapping India's Transportation Networks: Golden Quadrilateral vs. National Waterways

This project is a geospatial data visualization study that explores India's transportation system—specifically focusing on **roadways vs. inland waterways**—to understand regional connectivity and opportunities for development in underconnected areas.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Visualize and compare the **Golden Quadrilateral (GQ)** highway network and **13 operational National Waterways**.
- Highlight regions with limited connectivity (especially the North-Eastern region).
- Assess the **scope for expanding waterway infrastructure** using river and state-level data.
- Present spatial patterns in **infrastructure development, river usage**, and **state-wise waterway contribution**.

---

## 🌍 Tools & Technologies

- **Python Libraries:** Plotly, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas
- **Data Sources:** Shapefiles of India’s river systems, state boundaries, transportation networks
- **Visualization:** Choropleths, bar charts, river flow maps, state-wise stacked graphs

---

## 📊 Key Features

1. **Geographic Comparison**
   - Overlay of Golden Quadrilateral road network and 13 operational waterways.
   - State-wise and river-wise contribution analysis to active waterways.

2. **Stacked Bar Charts**
   - Distribution of each waterway by **state** and by **river source**.
   - Identifies states that benefit disproportionately or minimally from inland water transport.

3. **Highlighting North-Eastern India's Challenges**
   - Contextual analysis of terrain and isolation.
   - Justifies potential of waterways over roads in challenging terrains like Assam and Meghalaya.

4. **Connectivity Heatmaps**
   - Emphasizes disconnected regions and possible extensions.
   - Supports policy-level thinking for infrastructure planning.

## 📌 Insights & Recommendations

- Rivers like the Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Godavari serve as **critical water transport arteries**.
- Several states have **zero to minimal coverage** of operational waterways, suggesting opportunity for policy expansion.
- **Waterways can supplement or even outperform roads** in specific terrains like the North-East.
- A future roadmap could integrate GIS analysis with socioeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP, accessibility, logistics demand).
